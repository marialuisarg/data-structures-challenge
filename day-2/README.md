# Day 2: Simply Linked Lists | Data Structures Challenge - 7 Days Of Code

The challenge for today was to implement a patient management system in a hospital using simply linked lists.

Each patient should have a name, ID number, and their current health status, such as "stable," "in intensive care," "critical," and so on.

The system should allow adding of new patients, removing patients and listing all patients in order of arrival.

As an extra, I chose to implement a very simple user interface, so it's possible to interact by terminal. To test it, user must run the following lines:

```
g++ -g *.c* -o exec
.\exec
```
