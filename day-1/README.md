# Day 1: Arrays | Data Structures Challenge - 7 Days Of Code

The challenge for the day was to implement a simplified version of a shopping list using arrays. The list had to allow adding new items, removing items and listing all items.

When adding a new item, the user would have to enter the product name and the desired quantity. When removing an item, the user would have to specify the name of the product. Finally, when listing all items, the product name and quantity had to be displayed in a readable format. 

As an extra, I chose to implement a very simple user interface, so it's possible to interact by terminal. To test it, user must run the following lines:

```
g++ -g *.c* -o exec
.\exec
```
